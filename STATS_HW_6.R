# Q1
  # P(X = 1.5) = P(Y = 1.5) because both would be = to 0
  # P(X = 1.5) = 0 because binomial distributions are either 
  # one or the other outcome never a half outcome.
  # P(Y = 1.5) = 0 because any individual point on a normally
  # distributed graph = 0

# Q2
  # Normal Distribution (Mostly Standard Normal)
  # Z- and t-Tests
  # General Hypothesis Testing
  # Correlation
  # (Ordinary Least Squares, single X, single Y) Linear Regression

# Q3
  # Decreasing covariance, increasing noise and standard deviation
  # would lead to a decrease in correlation.

# Q4
  # The plots on wiki are all perfect and everything fits well
  # but the real world is messy and not perfectly correlated
  # or often influenced by an extremely large number of things.

# Q5
# just because food neophobia and masculinity are correlated
# in the burger king data doesn't mean that someone scores
# highly in food neophobia is necessarily more masculine.
